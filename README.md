# MW5Mercs Mods

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Currently quick fix for Ultrawide 32x9 UI.  I made this because r00k's great Ultrawide mods were not updated for SoK.  His HUD mod still works, so I only updated the UI.  This is specifically made for my monitor 32x9 5120x1440.  It may not work well for other resolutions/aspect ratios.  It basically pads 750 pixels on each side of the UI screens.
